In November 2025 the very fist edition of Voxxed Days Crete took place with an amazing line-up of speakers and 
topics. With more than 30 speakers and 300 attendees, the event was a great success and a great opportunity to meet and 
share knowledge with many people from the software development community. 

During this event I had the pleasure to be one of the speakers and present my talk "Are your tests good enough?" in 
front of a great audience. The abstract of the presentations was the following:

> If we use tests to test code, how can we test our own tests? We write tests in order to assure the quality of the 
> software we are writing. Software developers are usually trying to reach a certain level of code coverage through 
> their tests. However, the quality of the tests is not usually measured or examined through this process. It is 
> possible that someone can even achieve a high code coverage even without any assertion at all! This makes our test 
> suite not to fail even after major code changes. 
> In this session we will examine why and when a test can be considered as good or bad in terms of testability and 
> also move on and examine how mutation tests can allow us to test our tests in terms of efficiency. We will 
> investigate when we should run mutation tests, how to interpret the given results, and also how to generate 
> appropriate variations.

It was a great experience to be part of this event and share my knowledge with the community. I am looking forward to 
the next edition of Voxxed Days Crete and to meet again with all the amazing people I had the chance to meet during 
this event.
