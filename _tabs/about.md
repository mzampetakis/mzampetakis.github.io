I am a software engineer with a passion on software and technology! I am currently working at [Sunlight.io](https://sunlight.io/) as an API SW engineer. Solving challenging problems and improving code development lifecycle is what I mostly love to do. 

In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, cycling and "playing" with LEGO's.
Also, I am a co-organiser of the [DevStaff Community](https://devstaff.gr), a (Dis-)organiser of The [Socrates-Crete 2023](https://socrates-crete.org/) and (trying to) [contribute to OSS](https://github.com/mzampetakis?tab=repositories).

Also, I am trying to automate things in my home in order to make our lives easier. [Here is how!](https://github.com/mzampetakis/home-assistant-setup)
