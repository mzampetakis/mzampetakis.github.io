I am a software engineer with a passion for software crafting and technology! My devotion extends to Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), and I actively engage with software communities. My continuous pursuit of knowledge involves the exploration of emerging technologies, methodologies, and tools around the craft of making software. This acquired knowledge is used wisely to improve software creation lifecycle, especially when dealing with complex challenges. Through my professional journey, I have proven expertise in effective communication and seamless collaboration with diverse teams. The process of taking a concept and transforming it into a polished and functional software product is a source of personal satisfaction and fulfillment.

In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, cycling and "playing" with LEGO's.
Also, I am a co-organiser of the [DevStaff Community](https://devstaff.gr), a (Dis-)organiser of The [Socrates-Crete 2023](https://socrates-crete.org/) and (trying to) [contribute to OSS](https://github.com/mzampetakis?tab=repositories).

Also, I am trying to automate things in my home in order to make our lives easier. [Here is how!](https://github.com/mzampetakis/home-assistant-setup)
