I am a software engineer with a passion on software and technology! I am currently working at [Enartia](https://enartia.com) as a beckend SW engineer. Solving challenging problems and improving code development lifecycle is what I mostly love to do. 

In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, cycling and "playing" with LEGO's.
Also, I am co-organizing the [DevStaff Community](https://devstaff.gr) and (trying to) [contribute to OSS](https://github.com/mzampetakis?tab=repositories).

You can find out more about me in any of my social profiles appearing at the bottom left corner of this site.

>Always evolve, face challenges (of any kind) and solve problems.
